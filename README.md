# User Data Web App

A web application for displaying user information retrieved via a REST API. Users can view a list of users, filter and sort them, and update the user list on demand.

## Overview

The application consists of a user interface designed with HTML and styled with CSS. JavaScript is used to implement functionality such as fetching data from the REST API, rendering the user data dynamically, and enabling filtering and sorting options. Bootstrap is utilized for responsive design and layout components.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling language used for designing the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for implementing interactive features.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for styling and layout.
- **REST API**: Used to fetch user data from an external server.
